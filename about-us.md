We are a collegial group of researchers working (and based) around the world.

Our Co-Directors are [Jeremy Koster](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/kosterjy) and [Eleanor Power](https://eapower.github.io/). [Daniel Redhead](https://www.eva.mpg.de/ecology/staff/daniel-redhead/index.html) is our Assistant Director and oversees the creation and maintenance of the ENDOW dataset. They are supported and advised by the other members of the Governing Board: [Monique Borgerhoff Mulder](https://anthropology.ucdavis.edu/people/fzborger), [Samuel Bowles](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~bowles/), and [Matthew Jackson](https://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/). 

Over 40 researchers are collecting data for ENDOW from their fieldsites -- see the [Fieldsites page](https://endowproject.github.io/fieldsites/) for a full list. 

We are lucky to have been funded by the US [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) grant "The Effect of Social Networks on Inequality: A Longitudinal Cross-Cultural Investigation" (Award Number 1743019) through the [Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Science Research](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504832) (IBSS) competition, and the "Economic Networks and the Dynamics of Wealth Inequality: A Longitudinal Cross-Cultural Investigation" grant (Award Numbers 2218860 and 2218861) through the Cultural Anthropology and [Human Networks and Data Science](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/human-networks-data-science-hnds) programs.
